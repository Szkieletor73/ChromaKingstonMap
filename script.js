The Visages Doux are much more limber people, and are also beardless. They wear more cotton cloths, since they do not live in as harsh of a climate as Les Barbus. Les Visages Doux are regularly mistaken as part of Amethyst Cove citizens, since the boarder lands are very similar. But the Visages Doux enjoy reminding people of which Cove they are in. Les Visages Doux are much less reliant on fish than their northern friends. The weather permits them to farm much longer than in the north, as well as the large forests provide an excellent range of meats and herbs.<br>Even though both tribes are different, they both take pride in the land that they call home.
